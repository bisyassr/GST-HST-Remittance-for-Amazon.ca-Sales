# GST-HST-Remittance-for-Amazon.ca-Sales
This report addresses the disposition of Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) collected on sales made through the Amazon.ca platform, specifically clarifying why these amounts were not received by the seller in their settlement payouts. The analysis demonstrates that Amazon, operating as a designated Marketplace Facilitator (referred to as a "Distribution Platform Operator" by the Canada Revenue Agency), assumed the legal responsibility for calculating, collecting, and directly remitting GST/HST on specific domestic Canadian sales, effective July 1, 2021. Consequently, the tax amounts in question were directly remitted by Amazon to the CRA, fulfilling its statutory obligation. The report concludes that the GST/HST for these particular transactions has been properly accounted for and remitted by Amazon, and therefore, the seller bears no further remittance obligation for these specific amounts.
